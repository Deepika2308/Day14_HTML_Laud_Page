                    <h2>Rebel Poet</h2>
                    <p>Kazi Nazrul Islam is the national poet of Bangladesh who is <br>especially recognized as a Bidrohi Kobi
                    (rebel poet) around the <br>country. Nazrul is a famous poet, musician and philosopher of<br>
                    Bangladesh. The famous poet Nazrul's writings deal with the <br> revolution of that period of the British government. His
                    <br>revolutionary attempt helped him to be a national poet of<br>Bangladesh. He has raised his voice against
                    many kinds of fascism and<br> oppression and got popularity swiftly around the Indian<br> Subcontinet.</p>
